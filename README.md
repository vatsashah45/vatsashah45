- 👋 Hi, I’m Vatsa
- 👀 I’m interested in Web/App Development, Blockchain Development, AI and Software Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.JS and Node.JS
- 💞️ So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, MySQL, Java, C, C++, Lisp, Ruby, Prolog, Python and Git/Github under my belt. And I’m still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at vatsashah45@gmail.com or through LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/vatsashah01/
